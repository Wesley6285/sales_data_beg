Hello Tech enthusiast, this is my first "Data Analytics Project" called Sales Data. After i spend 1 1/2 month for learning Data Analytics eco system, decide to create a new project to flex my muscle😁. In this Project, i covered Python libraries Matplotlib, pandas, numpy and excel for data arranging.

Data Analytics are mainly focus on key areas like understand data -> process data -> clean data -> and lastly visualize data   

I create bar plot and pie chart for understand the outcomes of this sales data. 
        - In bar chart, i conclude that most of the products are sold in 2021 time period as compared to year and year time line 2023 year is an least amount of products sold. 
        - In pie chart, understand that most of the customer are choose to buy products on non-debit transcation like Debit-card, UPI and COD it holds arround 60.7, remaining Credit card and EMI transcation holds 39.4.
        - I attached pie chart and bar chart images in this repositry for your reference root -> Images/.png

I fetch this dataset(csv) from kaggle, to fetch this dataset or any data set make sure you have an account in kaggle. Dataset link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanugarg274/sales-dataset

In future, i will upload Many more Data Analytics and machine learning related projects are coming gets connected :)
